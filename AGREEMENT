Code style: indent Program

Working agreement: Attend all lab sessions at 3:30 on Monday. Stay in comunication about projects and deadlines. We are not going to branch unless previously communicated. Communicating by \
phone number and discord. For division of work we will trade off typing every other file. We will style the code in the way that we learned to do so at Appalachian State University. \
git will be used without branching always just pushing to the main branch we won't push broken code unless we want the partner to take a look at it and see if they can fix it. \
We will appear in lab at no later than 15:30 est and be prepared to stay the whole lab should that be required.
